## Introduction

Welcome to the "Debugging in C" repository as part of the ALX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROGRAMME. This repository is dedicated to helping developers understand and master the art of debugging C programs. Debugging is an essential skill for any programmer, and this repository aims to provide you with valuable insights into what debugging is, various manual debugging methods, and how to interpret error messages effectively.

## What is Debugging?

Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in a computer program. These errors can be logical errors, syntax errors, or runtime errors that prevent the program from working correctly. Debugging is a critical skill for software developers as it helps ensure the reliability and functionality of their code.

## Methods of Debugging Manually

Debugging can be performed manually using various methods, some of which include:

1. **Print Statements:** Adding print statements in your code to display the values of variables or the execution flow at specific points in the program.

2. **Code Inspection:** Carefully reviewing your code line by line to identify logical or syntactical errors.

3. **Rubber Duck Debugging:** Explaining your code and the problem you're facing to someone else, or even an inanimate object like a rubber duck, can often help you see the issue more clearly.

4. **Binary Search:** Narrowing down the problem's location by systematically testing different sections of the code until you find the problematic part.

5. **Use of Debugging Tools:** Utilizing debugging tools such as gdb (GNU Debugger) or IDE-specific debugging features to step through code and inspect variables during execution.

## Reading Error Messages

Error messages are valuable hints provided by the compiler or runtime environment when something goes wrong in your code. To effectively read and understand error messages:

1. **Read the Error Message:** Start by reading the error message carefully. It often contains information about the type of error, the file and line number where it occurred, and sometimes even a description of the issue.

2. **Check the Line Number:** Pay close attention to the line number mentioned in the error message. This helps you locate the specific part of your code that needs attention.

3. **Review the Code:** Go to the indicated line in your code and review it thoroughly. Look for syntax errors, incorrect variable usage, or other issues mentioned in the error message.

4. **Search Online:** If you're unsure about the error or need further guidance, don't hesitate to search online forums, documentation, or ask for help from peers.
