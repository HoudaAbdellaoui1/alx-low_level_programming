# ALX 2023 C Programming Loops

This repository contains sample scripts for general `if-else`, `do-while`, and `for` loop notions in the context of the ALX programme 2023. These scripts are intended to serve as a reference for C programming beginners to understand and practice the basic concepts of conditional statements and loops.

## Prerequisites

- C Compiler (GCC or Clang)
- Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

## Usage

Feel free to explore the different directories and open the scripts in your preferred text editor or IDE. Compile and run the C scripts using your C compiler to see the output.

For example, to compile and run a script from the `if_else` directory:

```
gcc -o if_else_sample if_else/sample.c
./if_else_sample
```
